# AOE-Reminders

AOE Reminders is a simple Windows application made in Python, made to be used with the real time strategy game Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition.

It is designed to help players with the most fundamental concepts of the game: creating villagers and building houses.

The application plays the audio cues 'CREATE VILLAGERS' and 'MAKE HOUSES' at an interval of the users choosing.

The idea is that it reduces idle town centre time, thereby maximising a players economy.
