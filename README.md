# AOE-Reminders

AOE Reminders is a simple Windows application made in Python, made to be used alongside the real time strategy game Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition. It does not interact with the game in any way, however.

It is designed to help players with the most fundamental concepts of the game: creating villagers and building houses.

The application plays the audio cues 'CREATE VILLAGERS' and 'MAKE HOUSES' at an interval of the users choosing.

The idea is that it reduces idle town centre time, thereby maximising a players economy.

This is version 1.0.0.0.0.0. I aim to play around with it and hopefully translate it to a web-app and include build-orders.
